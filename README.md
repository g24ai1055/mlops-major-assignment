# 🧠 MLOps: Linear Regression with Quantization

[![CI Status](https://github.com/g24ai1055/mlops-major-assignment/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/g24ai1055/mlops-major-assignment/actions)

A simple end-to-end MLOps project that:
- Trains a Linear Regression model on the California Housing dataset
- Performs manual quantization
- Runs unit tests
- Builds a Docker container and tests predictions inside it
- Automates the pipeline via GitHub Actions

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔧 Locally

```bash
# Create and activate venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train model
python src/train.py

# Quantize parameters
python src/quantize.py

# Predict from saved model
python src/predict.py
````

---

### 🐳 Using Docker

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t mlops-lr .

# Run container and trigger prediction
docker run --rm mlops-lr
```

## 🔁 GitHub Actions CI/CD

| Stage            | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Unit Tests     | Runs `pytest` on `tests/`                   |
| ✅ Model Training | Trains Linear Regression                    |
| ✅ Quantization   | Applies manual quantization                 |
| ✅ Docker Test    | Builds and runs prediction inside container |

Workflow automatically runs **on every push to `main`**.
