# ✅ MLOps Assignment: End-to-End Pipeline with Quantization

This document summarizes the components and workflow used in the submission for the MLOps assignment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This assignment implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline that:
- Trains a Linear Regression model on the California Housing dataset
- Performs manual quantization of model weights
- Runs unit tests on utility functions
- Builds and tests a Docker container for prediction
- Automates CI using GitHub Actions

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔧 Locally

```bash
# Setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train model
python src/train.py

# Quantize model
python src/quantize.py

# Predict
python src/predict.py
````

### 🐳 Using Docker

```bash
docker build -t mlops-lr .
docker run --rm mlops-lr
```

---

## 🔗 GitHub Actions

CI/CD pipeline runs on every push and performs:

* Unit Testing
* Training & Quantization
* Docker Build & Test

Check [CI Status Badge in README](./README.md) for real-time status.

---

## 🙌 Final Notes

* All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`
* GitHub Actions are defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
* All scripts tested locally and in container
* All workflow stages successfully completed

```
